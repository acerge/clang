## 5.1 GCC 搜索路径

When environment variables and command-line options are used together the compiler searches the directories in the following order:

#### 1） command-line options ‘-I’ and ‘-L’, from left to right

#### 2） directories specified by environment variables, such as C\_INCLUDE\_PATH and LIBRARY\_PATH

#### 3）default system directories
