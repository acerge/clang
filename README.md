### 1.2 C++11 String Initialization

As you might expect by now, C++11 enables list-initialization for C-style strings and

string objects:

```cpp
char first_date[] = {"Le Chapon Dodu"};
char second_date[] {"The Elegant Plate"};
string third_date = {"The Bread Bowl"};
string fourth_date {"Hank's Fine Eats"};
```

```cpp
struct inflatable goose; // keyword struct required in C
inflatable vincent; // keyword struct not required in C++
```

```cpp
enum spectrum {red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet, indigo, ultraviolet};
```
